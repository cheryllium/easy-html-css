Next, let's say you want your page to have three distinct sections: the header, the content, and the footer. And you want each of these to look a little differently, using CSS. It's time to talk about CSS classes and IDs. 

A CSS ID is just another way to specify that something needs to be styled. We use an ID on something when there is only one of it on the entire webpage. For example, there is usually only one header and footer on a webpage, so these commonly are styled using IDs. To give something an ID, we name the ID anything we would like (like "header"), and then use the `id` HTML attribute:

```html
<div id="header">
  <h1>Welcome to my Webpage!</h1>
</div>
```

Then, in the CSS, we can style this. For example, we could give a header a width and a height. To style an ID, it is just like styling a tag, except we put a **hashtag symbol** in front of the ID's name.

```html
<style>
#header {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100px;
}
</style>
```

This code will select everything with `id="header"` (which should only be one thing!) A note about the new properties here: `width` and `height` can be specified in pixels (px) or in percentages, among other options. The percentages refer to the size of whatever the element is inside of. Since the `#header` element is not inside of another element, the percentages refer to the browser's width and height.

CSS classes work almost the same way, except you can have **multiple** elements on a page with the same class. You would specify a class using the HTML attribute class. For instance, say we have a class called "red":

```html
<div class="red"></div>
```

We style this just like the id, except we use a **period** instead of a hashtag in front of the name. The following code will give a red background to every element with the attribute class="red".

```
<style>
.red {
  background-color: #ff0000;
}
</style>
```

To recap, a **CSS selector** can be the name of a tag, but it can also be the name of an ID or class. When it's an ID, we put `#` before the name, and when it's a class, we put `.` before the name. 

<div class="try-it">
<p>Try making an HTML page with a header, footer, and content. You might remember that, in the HTML section of the tutorial, we discussed a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code> tag which defines a section of a page. This is the perfect time to use it! The header, footer, and content sections should each be a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id="header"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my Webpage!&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id="content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm learning HTML and CSS!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id="footer"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Website made with love.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Take a moment to understand what is happening here: There are three <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code> tags, with the IDs of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">header</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">footer</code>. Weâ€™ve written a little bit of HTML inside of each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code>. Whatever CSS you write for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code> will apply to everything that is inside it by default!</p>

<p>Now, try using CSS to give each section a different style. You can give them different background colors, font colors, and fonts. You can even give them different widths and heights. Give it a try!</p>
</div>
