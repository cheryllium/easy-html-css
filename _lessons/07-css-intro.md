Now we're getting to the fun part! Let's talk for a little bit about what CSS is, and then we'll dive right in to the code.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets - something else that's a fun fact to know, but you don't really need to understand right now. Remember how I said that HTML tells the webpage **what** to do? Well, CSS tells you **how** to do it. For example, HTML might tell you that you want to emphasize a piece of text. It's the CSS that tells you how the text will be emphasized - perhaps you want it to be both bolded and italicized, as well as bright pink. You can do that with CSS, and more.

In this little tutorial, we will first cover basic styling of HTML tags. Then, we will talk about classes and ids. Finally, we'll go over some basic coding with divs.
