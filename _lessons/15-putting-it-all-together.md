Congratulations on making it this far into the tutorial! You're right at the end now, and you're ready to put what you've learned together. You've already learned: 

- How to write basic HTML and CSS
- How to make multiple HTML files on your computer, open them in the web browser, and link them together
- How to add images to your page
- How to set things like fonts, borders, and colors on your page and things in your page
- How to arrange your webpage into a header, sidebar, content and footer

With this, you can really begin to make your very own basic website! I encourage you now to try and make a basic website on your computer. Even if no one ever sees it, it will be a great start to your web development journey. Practice is the best, and only way, to get good!

For example, try making an About Me website with multiple pages about you, your hobbies, and interests. You could also make a website about anything you like, such as an animal or TV show or band. 

While you're making your site, don't be afraid to go out and learn more than what this simple tutorial has taught you. For example, maybe you want to set a tiling image as your page background. You can easily search up how to write the CSS for a background image. Remember that CSS attributes will always look like `ATTRIBUTE: VALUE;` and you will be all set. 

If you do want to put your website online, here are two FREE places you can do it: 

1. **[Neocities](https://neocities.org/)** - Like the famous Geocities of old, Neocities is a place where you can build your own free website one page at a time. It features a way for you to edit the HTML of your webpages directly in the browser. 
2. **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)** - My favorite choice, hosting your website on Netlify is as easy as dragging and dropping the folder containing your website into Netlify. 

All right, that's all for now. I hope you found this tutorial helpful - now go out there and have fun building your new site!
