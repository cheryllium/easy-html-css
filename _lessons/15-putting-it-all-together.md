Congratulations on making it this far into the tutorial! At this point, you've already learned: 

- How to write basic HTML and CSS
- How to make multiple HTML files on your computer, open them in the web browser, and link them together
- How to add images to your page
- How to set things like fonts, borders, and colors on your page and things in your page
- How to arrange two elements on your page side-by-side

With this, you are ready to put all of it together in **your first project**. The next section of this tutorial will walk you through combining these elements to create a nice-looking webpage. Along the way, you'll learn some new CSS, and I'll also show you how to use the browser inspector to preview CSS changes in real time. Without further ado, let's begin!
