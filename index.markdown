Hello! I'm Cheshire, and this is my easy HTML/CSS tutorial. The purpose of this tutorial is to get you to a good starting point where you can have fun building your own websites with HTML and CSS. This tutorial is geared towards non-programmers, so instead of going super in-depth and overwhelming you with technical details, it will tell you what you need to know to start building your own basic webpages fast. 

The HTML section goes over what HTML looks like, a couple common HTML tags, and the structure of an HTML page. The CSS section is where things get really fun: I introduce what CSS is, and go over how to change things like your font and font color, background color, borders, and more. 

Finally, the last section, "Your First Project", gives you a chance to put your newfound skills in action. You'll create and customize a simple webpage from scratch, and finally learn how to link it with other pages to create a full website. You'll learn a few more tips and tricks along the way.

To get the most out of this tutorial, make sure you follow along with the sections that say "try it yourself!" The best way to learn programming is by doing it. 

Click on "Intro to HTML" in the sidebar to get started. Have fun!
